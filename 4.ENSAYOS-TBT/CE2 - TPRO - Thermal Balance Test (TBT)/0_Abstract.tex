This document is a test specification (TSPE) and test procedure (TPRO) document for the thermal balance test (TBT) to be carried out for the correlation and future validation of the thermal model for the TASEC-Lab (B2Space) project. The results obtained from this test will then be used to correlate the thermal model.
