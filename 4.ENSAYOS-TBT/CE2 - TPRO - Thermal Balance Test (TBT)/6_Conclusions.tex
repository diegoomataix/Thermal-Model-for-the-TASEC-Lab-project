\section{Concluding Remark} \label{sec:Conclusions}

This documents has intended to provide the reader with the information regarding the test specification (TSPEC) and the test procedure (TPRO) that has been proposed for the thermal balance test (TBT) to be carried out for the correlation and future validation of the thermal model for the TASEC-Lab (B2Space) project. The test procedure follows the guidelines for the points relevant to this project, which are stated in section 5.5.4 of the ECSS-E-ST-10-03C document. The results obtained from this test will then be used to correlate the thermal model. \\

It is essential that this document is reviewed and understood before carrying out the testing campaign for the TASEC-Lab project.
