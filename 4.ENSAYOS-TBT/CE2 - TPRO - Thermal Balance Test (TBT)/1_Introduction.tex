\section{Introduction} \label{sec:Introduction}

This documents intends to provide the reader with the information regarding the test specification (TSPEC) and the test procedure (TPRO) that has been proposed for the thermal balance test (TBT) to be carried out for the correlation and future validation of the thermal model for the TASEC-Lab (B2Space) project. The results obtained from this test will then be used to correlate the thermal model.  The test procedure follows the guidelines, for the points relevant to this project, stated in section 5.5.4 of the ECSS-E-ST-10-03C document.

\subsection{Purpose} 
The relevance of heat transfer studies for the conditions present in the stratosphere is increasing as stratospheric balloon missions are becoming increasingly popular for their low cost and ease of access to universities and other research centers. 

\subsection{Scope}
The scope of the TBT is to obtain a relevant data-set that can be used to correlate the results to the thermal model developed. The scope of this document is to provide the procedure requiered to carry out the TBT at the facilities available at the \textit{Instituto de Microgravedad - Ignacio Da Riva (IDR)} at the Polytechnic University of Madrid.
