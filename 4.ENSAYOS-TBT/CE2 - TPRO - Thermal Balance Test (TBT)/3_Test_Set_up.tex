\section{Test Set-up} \label{sec:Test_set_up}
This section aims to provide the reader with the information regarding the test set-up for the TBT in the TVC.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Thermal interface}

\begin{itemize}
    \item{Conductive interface: The CubeSat is supported on top of the base plate through a series of rubber supports without employing any mechanical interfaces.}
    \item{Radiative interface: The base plate and shroud are the radiative interfaces.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Placement of the temperature sensors}

The temperature sensors that will be employed in the thermal vacuum chamber are thermocouple wires due to their flexibility and availability for a low cost.
