# Thermal-Model-for-the-TASEC-Lab-project
 Correlating the thermal model of the B2Space 3U cubesat with the available flight data for the TASEC-Lab project.
 
 The files containing the thermal model developed for the project are available in GitLab, through the following link: https://gitlab.com/Alferso2/b2space. Only the changes made from September 2021 in the Diego_WS branch have been created by me, as this is part of a larger project involving other collaborators.
